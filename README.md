# meal_decider
A program for helping you decide what cuisine to get for your next dinner date.

This project was an excercise in using HTML5 local storage. 

Users can select existing cuisine options or add their own, and save their selections to access at a later date via the same browser.

The program uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm to randomize the order of the selected options and chooses the first item in the randomized array. 

This program uses a combination of jQuery and Vanilla javascript to achive the desired results.
